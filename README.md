To confirm some results, put the bellow commands
./waf --run "scratch/mc-downlink -buildingTopology=building_topology.txt -nPacket=7142"

You can change the building density by text file, "building_topology.txt", which has 4000 blockages/𝑘𝑚^2.
The parameter, nPacktet, indicates the number of packets consisting of one file, and each packet size is 1400 byte.
