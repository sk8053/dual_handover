\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Model the error rate for different modulations.

A packet of interest (e.\+g., a packet can potentially be received by the M\+AC) is divided into chunks. Each chunk is related to an start/end receiving event. For each chunk, it calculates the ratio (S\+I\+NR) between received power of packet of interest and summation of noise and interfering power of all the other incoming packets. Then, it will calculate the success rate of the chunk based on B\+ER of the modulation. The success reception rate of the packet is derived from the success rate of all chunks. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
