\subsection{Detailed Description}
Assert functions and macros. 

The assert macros are used to verify at runtime that a certain condition is true. If it is not true, the program halts. These checks are built into the program only in debugging builds. They are removed in optimized builds.

These macro are intended to check certain conditions to be true. Do not put code that also have side effects that your program relies on (eg. code that advances an iterator and return false at end of file) because the code will not be executed on release builds!!

If assertion-\/style checks are required for release builds, use N\+S\+\_\+\+A\+B\+O\+R\+T\+\_\+\+U\+N\+L\+E\+SS and N\+S\+\_\+\+A\+B\+O\+R\+T\+\_\+\+M\+S\+G\+\_\+\+U\+N\+L\+E\+SS.
