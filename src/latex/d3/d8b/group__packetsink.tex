\subsection{Detailed Description}
This application was written to complement \hyperlink{classns3_1_1OnOffApplication}{On\+Off\+Application}, but it is more general so a \hyperlink{classns3_1_1PacketSink}{Packet\+Sink} name was selected. Functionally it is important to use in multicast situations, so that reception of the layer-\/2 multicast frames of interest are enabled, but it is also useful for unicast as an example of how you can write something simple to receive packets at the application layer. Also, if an IP stack generates I\+C\+MP Port Unreachable errors, receiving applications will be needed.
